00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,020
Hi! My name is Paola,
and I am a software engineer at Microsoft.

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:20,130
Let's talk about how the internet
works. My job relies on networks being able

3
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,489
to talk with one another, but back in the
1970s there was no standard method for this.

4
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:33,840
It took the work of Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn
to invent the internet working protocol, to make communication possible.

5
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,820
This invention
laid the groundwork for what we now call the internet.

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,460
The internet is a network of networks.
It links billions of devices together all

7
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:51,230
around the globe. So maybe you're connected
with a laptop or a phone through wifi, then

8
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,999
that wifi connection connects to an internet
service provider (or ISP), and that ISP connects

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,520
you to billions and billions of devices around
the world through hundreds of thousands of

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,860
networks that are all interconnected.

11
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:15,840
One thing that most people do not appreciate is that the internet is really a design philosophy and an architecture expressed in a set of protocols.

12
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,300
A protocol is a well known set
of rules and standards, that if all parties

13
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,840
agree to use it, will allow them to communicate
without trouble.

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,360
How the internet actually physically works is less important than the fact that this design philosophy

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,460
has allowed the internet to adapt and absorb new communication technologies.

16
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:43,480
This is because in order for a new technology to use the internet in some fashion, it just needs to know which protocols to work with.

17
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,500
All the different devices on
the internet have unique addresses.

18
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,340
An address on the internet is just a number, similar
to a phone number or a sort of street address,

19
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,720
that's unique to each computer or device at
the edge of the network.

20
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,680
This is similar to how most homes and businesses have a mailing address. You don't need to know a person to

21
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,900
send them a letter in the mail, but you do
need to know their address and how to write

22
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,180
the address properly so the letter can be
carried by a mail system to its destination.

23
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,870
The addressing system for computers on the
internet is similar and it forms part of one

24
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:26,100
of the most important protocols used in internet
communication simply called the internet protocol or IP.

25
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,900
A computer's address then is called
its IP address. Visiting a website is really

26
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,620
just your computer asking another computer
for information. Your computer sends a message

27
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,280
to the other computer's IP address and it
also sends along its origin address, so the

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,760
other computer knows where to send its response.

29
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:54,900
You may have seen an IP address. It's just a bunch of numbers! These numbers are organized
in a hierarchy. Just like a home address has

30
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,420
a country, a city, a street, and a house number,
an IP address has many parts.

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:09,520
Just like all digital data, each of these numbers is represented in bits. Traditional IP addresses are 32 bits

32
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,760
long, with 8 bits for each part of the address.

33
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,840
The earlier numbers usually identify the country and regional network of the device.

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,140
Then come
the subnetworks, and then finally the address

35
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:29,380
of the specific device. This version of IP
addressing is called IPv4. It was designed

36
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:38,100
in 1973 and was widely adopted in the early 80s, and provides for more than 4 billion unique addresses for devices connecting to the internet.

37
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:48,300
But the internet has turned out to be much more popular than even Vint Cerf imagined and 4 billion unique addresses won't be enough.

38
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,260
We're now in the middle of
a multi-year transition to a longer IP address

39
00:03:53,260 --> 00:04:04,900
format called IPv6, which uses 128 bits per address and provides over 340 undecillion unique addresses.

40
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,600
That's more than enough for every grain of sand on Earth to have its own IP address.

41
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,900
Most users never see or care
about internet addresses.

42
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:23,400
A system called the domain name system or DNS associates names like www.example.com with the corresponding addresses.

43
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,020
Your computer uses the DNS to look
up domain names and get the associated IP

44
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,280
address which is used to connect your computer
to the destination on the internet.

45
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,050
And it goes a little something like this: (voice
1) "Hey, hi there, I want to go to www.code.org."

46
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:47,760
(voice 2) "Mm.. yeah I don't know the IP address
for that domain let me ask around. Hey, do

47
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:59,100
you know how to get to code.org?" (voice 3)
"Yeah, I got it right here it's 174.129.14.120."

48
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,500
(voice 2) "Oh okay, great, thanks. I'm gonna
write that down and save it for later in case

49
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,400
I need it again. Hey here's that address you
wanted." (voice 1) "Awesome! Thank you."

50
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:20,720
So how do we design a system for billions of
devices to find any one of billions of different websites?

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,900
There is no way one DNS server can
handle all the requests from all devices.

52
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,000
The answer is that DNS servers are connected
in a distributed hierarchy, and are divided

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,699
into zones, splitting up responsibility for
the major domains such as .org, .com, .net, etc.

54
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:48,020
DNS was originally created to be an open
and public communication protocol for government

55
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,900
and educational institutions. Because of its
openness, DNS is susceptible to cyber attacks.

56
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,540
An example attack is DNS spoofing. That's
when a hacker taps into a DNS server and changes

57
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:09,479
it to match a domain name with the wrong IP
address. This lets the attacker send people

58
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,740
to an imposter website. If this happens to
you, you are vulnerable for more problems

59
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,100
because you are using that fake website as
if it's real.

60
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,280
The internet is huge and getting bigger everyday.

61
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,780
But the domain name system
and internet protocol are designed to scale,

62
00:06:30,780 --> 00:00:00,000
no matter how much the internet grows.
