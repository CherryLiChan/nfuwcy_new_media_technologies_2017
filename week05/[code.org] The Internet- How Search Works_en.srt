Hi, my name is John. I lead the search and
machine learning teams at Google.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,960
I think it's amazingly inspiring that people all
over the world

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,710
turn to search engines to ask
trivial questions and incredibly

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,520
important questions, so it's a huge responsibility to give them the best answers that we can.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,940
Hi, my name is
Akshaya and I work on the Bing search team.

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,200
There are many times where we'll
start looking into artificial

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,280
intelligence and machine learning, but we
have to address how are the users going

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,820
to use this because end of the day we
want to make an impact to society.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,500
Let's ask a simple question.
"How long does it take to travel to Mars?"

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,920
Where did these results come from and 
why was this listed before the other one?

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,180
Okay, let's dive in and see how the
search engine turned your request into a result.

12
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,750
The first thing you need to know
 is when you do a search, the search

13
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,240
engine isn't actually going out to the 
World Wide Web to run your search in real time.

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,040
That's because there's
 over a billion websites on the internet

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,450
and hundreds more being created every
single minute, so if the search engine

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,780
had to look through every single site to
find the one you wanted, it would just take forever.

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,490
So to make your search faster,
search engines are constantly scanning

18
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,400
the web in advance to record the
information that might help with your search later.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,220
That way when you search
about "travel to Mars" the search engine

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,280
already has what it needs to give you an
answer in real time.

21
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,880
Here's how it works:

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,340
The internet is a web of pages connected
to each other by hyperlinks.

23
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,500
Search engines are constantly running a program
called "spider" that crawls through

24
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,660
these web pages to collect information
about them.

25
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:57,120
Each time it finds a hyperlink, it follows it until it has
visited every page it can find on the entire internet.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,600
For each page of the
spider visits, it records any information

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,680
it might need for a search by adding it to
a special database called a search index.

28
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,900
Now, let's go back to that search from
earlier and see if we can figure out how

29
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,520
the search engine came up with the results.

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,920
When you ask "how long does it take to travel to Mars", the search engine looks each of those words in the

31
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,840
search index to immediately get a list of all
the pages on the internet containing

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,280
those words, but just looking for these
search terms could return millions of

33
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,360
pages so the search engine needs to be
able to determine the best matches to show you first.

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,880
This is where it gets tricky because the search engine may need to guess what you're looking for.

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:44,280
Each search engine uses its own algorithm to rank the pages based on what it thinks you want.

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,480
The search engine's ranking algorithm might check if
your search term shows up in the page title,

37
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,790
it might check if all of the words
show up next to each other, or any number

38
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,800
of other calculations that helped it better determine which pages you'll want to see and which you won't.

39
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,440
Google invented
the most famous algorithm for choosing

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,360
the most relevant results for a search, by taking into account how many other web pages link to a given page.

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,260
The idea is that if lots of websites think that a

42
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,820
web page is interesting, then it's
probably the one you're looking for.

43
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,000
This algorithm was called "Page Rank", not because it ranks web pages, but because

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,220
it was named after its inventor, Larry
Page, who is one of the founders of Google.

45
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,020
Because the website often makes money
when you visit it, spammers are constantly

46
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,920
trying to find ways to game the search algorithm so that their pages are listed higher in the results.

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,840
Search engines
regularly update their algorithms to

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,480
prevent fake or untrustworthy sites from
reaching the top.

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,120
Ultimately, it's up to you to keep an eye out for these
pages that are untrustworthy by looking

50
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,340
at the web address and making sure it's
a reliable source.

51
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:00,560
Search programs are always evolving to 
improve the algorithms so the return better results, faster results then their competitors.

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,560
Today's search engines even use 
information that you haven't explicitly provided to help you narrow down your search.

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,380
So, for example, if you did a
search for dog parks, many search engines

54
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,980
would give you results for all the dogs parks nearby even though you didn't type in your location.

55
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:24,320
Modern search engines also understand
more than just the words on a page, but what they actually mean in order to find

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,040
the best one that matches what you're
looking for.

57
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,180
For example, if you search for a "fast pitcher" it will know you're looking for an athlete, but if you search

58
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,200
for "large pitcher" it will find you options for you kitchen.

59
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,380
To understand the words better, we use something called machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence.

60
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,340
It enables search algorithms
to search not just individual letters or

61
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,800
words in the page, but understand the
underlying meaning of the words.

62
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:59,039
The internet is growing exponentially, but if the
teams that design search engines do our

63
00:04:59,040 --> 00:00:00,000
jobs right, the information you want should
always be just a few keystrokes away.
