Hi, my name is Jenny Martin and I'm the
director of cybersecurity investigations at Symantec.

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,200
Today cybercrime causes huge problems for society

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,740
personally, financially, and even
in matters of national security.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,660
Just in the last few years, hundreds of millions of credit card numbers have been stolen,

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:31,460
tens of millions of Social Security
numbers and healthcare records were compromised,

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,680
even nuclear centrifuges
that have been hacked,

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,400
and unmanned aerial drones have been hijacked.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,090
This is all done by exploiting vulnerabilities

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,059
in hardware and software or more often
by taking advantage of unintentional

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,920
decisions made by the people using the software.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,440
The people committing these cyber crimes 
don't fit a single profile or motivation.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,920
It could be anyone from an international terrorist to a teenager competing for bragging rights.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,620
Today the largest countries not only have a regular army
but also have a well armed cyber army.

14
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,500
In fact, the next World War may not be
fought with traditional weapons, but with

15
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,210
computers used to shut down national
water supplies, energy grids, and

16
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,920
transportation systems.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,540
Hi my name is Parisa and
I'm Google's Security Princess.

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,540
I've worked on a lot of different Google products
in a lot of different ways to try and

19
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,880
make our software as secure as possible.

20
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,690
Now let's take a look at how cybercrime
works under the hood.

21
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:42,020
We'll learn about software viruses,
denial-of-service attacks, and phishing scams.

22
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,170
In biology and life, a virus is an
organism that is spread by coughing,

23
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,700
sneezing, or physical contact.

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,360
Viruses work by infecting cells,
injecting their genetic material, and

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,400
using those cells to replicate. They can make people really sick and then spread to other people.

26
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,290
A computer virus works bit similarly. A
virus is an executable program that gets

27
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,220
installed, usually unintentionally, 
and harms the user and their computer.

28
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,073
It's also possible for a virus to spread itself to other
computers.

29
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,220
Now how does a virus get on your 
computer in the first place?

30
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,700
There are a couple ways an attacker can 
infect someone's computer.

31
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,730
They might lure a victim into
installing a program with deception about the

32
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,200
program's purpose, so for example a lot
of viruses are disguised as security updates.

33
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,920
It's also possible that the software on your computer has a vulnerability, so an attacker can install itself

34
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,500
without even needing explicit permission.

35
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,580
Once a virus is on your computer it can
steal or delete any of your files,

36
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,560
control other programs, or even allow
someone else to remotely control your computer.

37
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,820
Using computer viruses, hackers can take
over millions of computers world wide

38
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,280
and then use them as a digital army, otherwise known as a botnet, to attack and take down websites.

39
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,680
This kind of attack is called a
distributed denial of service.

40
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,280
A denial of service is when hackers
overwhelm a website with too many requests.

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,300
We call it a distributed denial-of-service when the attack comes from many computers all at once.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,940
Most websites are ready to respond to
millions of requests a day, but if you

43
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,430
hit them with billions or trillions of requests, 
coming from different places,

44
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,600
the computers are overloaded and stop
responding.

45
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,960
Another trick used by cybercriminals is to send large amounts of spam email in an attempt to trick people

46
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,110
into sharing sensitive personal information.

47
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,920
This is called a phishing scam. 
A phishing scam is when you get what seems like a

48
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,590
trustworthy email asking you to log
into your account, but clicking the email

49
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,560
takes you to a fake website.

50
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,599
If you log in anyway, you've been
tricked into giving your password away.

51
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,390
Hackers can then use your login
credentials to access your real accounts

52
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,520
to steal information or maybe even to
steal your money. Fortunately there are

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,920
many companies, laws, and government
organizations working to make the

54
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,040
internet safer, but these 
efforts are not enough.

55
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,440
You may think when a computer system
gets hacked the problem was the security

56
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,860
design or the software. Ninety percent
of the time the system gets hacked

57
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,440
however, it's not because of the security bug, but because of a simple mistake made by a human.

58
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,460
It turns out there are steps we
can all take to protect ourselves.

59
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,040
Often your actions not only impact the
security of your own data and computer, but the

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,550
security of everyone at your school,

61
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,510
workplace, and home. With billions or
trillions of dollars at stake,

62
00:04:46,510 --> 00:00:00,000
cybercriminals get smarter each year and
we all need to keep up.
